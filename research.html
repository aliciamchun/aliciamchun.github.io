								<h3>Characterizing Subaru Telescope's Deformable Mirror</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/research/Optics/twinkle.gif" alt="" /></span>
									Imagine swimming underwater and looking up at the clouds. From this perspective, 
									the clouds are distorted and moving rapidly. The same concept applies for stars 
									and our atmosphere: the <i>twinkle</i> in stars are due to variations in atmosphere 
									refractions. These abberations make it difficult to precisely image extrasolar objects. <i>

									Adaptive Optics (AO) is a subfield of astronomy instrumentation aims to reduce 
									these abberations. It utilizes a Deformable Mirror (DM) that has several actuators 
									within its mirror that shifts the wave front to fix image distortions caused by 
									astomspheric turbulance.

									The National Astronomical Observatory of Japan's (NAOJ) Subaru Telescope has an 
									instrument that works to reduce abberations in order to image exoplanets called 
									Subaru Coronographic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO). SCExAO's old DM has 
									188 actuators that deform the wave front. The new DM, designed by ALPAO, has 
									over 3000 actuators and is called the AO3k.

									I worked with Dr. Olivier Guyon and Dr. Julien Lozi to characterize the movement 
									of each actuator in the AO3k. I found three unexpected behaviors with the AO3k 
									including unresponsive actuators, uneven actuator response, and elevated actuator 
									response around the mirror edge. I presented these findings to ALPAO and we sent 
									the AO3k back to France for repairs in these behaviors. Julien Lozi submitted a paper
									to SPIE in June 2024 on the opto-mechanical design, integration and lab tests of the AO3k
									and additional imporvements on SCExAO, which you can see below.

							<h3>Asteroseismic Detection Limits of Ground-Based Transient Surveys</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/research/Asteroseismology/asteroseismology.gif" alt="" /></span>
								M-giant stars pulsate with long periods and with large changes in luminosity. They can pulsate
								with periods spanning days to months; for reference, our sun has an oscillation period of 5 minutes. 
								These pulsations are the baseline for asteroseismology, the study of internal structures of stars 
								via their oscillations.

								It is typical practice to use space-based telescopes like TESS and Kepler to conduct
								asteroseismic analysis. However, when looking at specifically M-giant stars, 
								space-based telescopes have some inherent drawbacks: 
								<li><b>field-of-view is restricted</b>: It would be almost impossible to map out 
									the northern hemisphere with only data from space-based 
									telescopes, as they are often focused on only one part of 
									the sky for a limited period of time.</li>
								<li><b>observation baseline might be too short:</b> Since these stars have a <i>long</i> oscillation period, 
								the observation baseline needs to be long enough to accurately capture the correct frequency. The observation
								baseline must span months to years to capture an accurate frequency.</li>
							<p>
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/research/Asteroseismology/ASASSN.png" alt="" /></span>
								I worked with Professor Daniel Huber and PhD student Nicholas Saunders at the 
								University of Hawai`i at Mānoa, Institute for Astronomy to see if we could detect 
								these oscillations in M-giants with <b>ground-based transient surveys</b>. Although 
								these surveys do not have the resolution of space-based telescopes, they have a field-of-view
								that captures the entire sky with observation baselines upwards of 2 years. Additionally, M-giant
								stars might have an amplitude oscillation high enough to be captured by the resolution of ground-based
								surveys. 
							<p>
							<p>
								Using data from the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) telescope, 
								I found that ASAS-SN can retrieve these pulsations for M-giants with frequencies 
								below 1 µHz (aka. periods above 11 days) within the 9th mag to 13th mag in the 
								Gaia band. With this, ASAS-SN can characterize distances for ~5 million M-giants. 
								I presented my work at the TASC7/KASC14 conference in Honolulu, HI, at the AAS243rd 
								Conference, and in a talk at UH Mānoa's REU symposium. You can view my AAS poster and 
								a recording of my talk below.
